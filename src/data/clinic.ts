/**
 * ── CLIENT REVISION 2 + 8 — THE HIGHLIGHTS ────────────────────────────
 *
 * The client's revision note asks for these twice, and deliberately so:
 *
 *   note 2 — "The Highlights:" the first FOUR, as a highlight strip.
 *   note 8 — "Why Patients choose Healthy Look? Not All Aesthetic Providers
 *             Are Equal", all SIX, as a full section.
 *
 * One array serves both, so the wording can never drift between the strip
 * near the top of the homepage and the section further down. <Highlights>
 * takes `.slice(0, 4)` and shows titles only; <WhyUs> takes all six with
 * their descriptions. The titles are the client's own, verbatim, including
 * their capitalisation and their singular "Product".
 *
 * ⚠ THE DESCRIPTIONS ARE NOT NEW COPY. The client supplied six headings and
 * no body text, and on a medical site inventing the body text is how a
 * marketing claim gets made by accident. Every sentence below is therefore
 * assembled from material the clinic has already published — each entry
 * records where its own claim comes from, and anything that could not be
 * sourced was left unsaid rather than filled in.
 *
 * ── WHY THERE ARE TWO LENGTHS ─────────────────────────────────────────
 * `tagline` is for the strip in <Highlights>, `description` for the full
 * section in <WhyUs>. Both say the same thing from the same source; they
 * differ in length because they are read differently — a three-word line
 * under a title in a service strip gets a glance, a numbered list halfway
 * down the page gets read.
 *
 * Keeping them as separate strings rather than truncating one at render
 * time is deliberate: a clipped sentence on a medical claim can change
 * what the claim says ("…administered by a licensed doctor, unless…").
 * Each one is written to be complete at its own length.

 * precisely why the section is worth having. A clinic in Ubud is being

 *
