/**
 * Renders the clinic's real price groups.
 *
 * Set as a typographic table rather than as pricing cards. Three-column
 * pricing cards imply tiers ("good / better / best") that this clinic
 * doesn't offer, and they'd make a doctor-led medical service look like a
 * subscription product. A quiet table is also what "transparent pricing"
 * actually looks like.
 *
 * `price: null` renders the live site's own wording — "By Consultation" —
 * rather than a zero or a blank cell. One row on the real price list is
 * genuinely quoted that way (Dermapen stretch marks), and showing
 * "IDR 0" there would be worse than showing nothing.

                    real price rows carry long slash-joined labels — e.g.
                    "One Session per Area (Belly/Arm/Thigh/Brazilian Butt
                    lift)". CSS puts no break opportunity around a slash, so
                    that run counts as one 197px-wide "word", and a flex item
                    at the default min-width:auto refuses to shrink below its
                    min-content width. On a 320px phone the label therefore
                    held its full width, shoved the shrink-0 price column off
                    the right edge, and gave the whole page a horizontal
                    scrollbar. Letting the label shrink and break keeps the
                    row inside the viewport without touching the price list
                    wording, which has to stay exactly as the clinic quotes it. */}
